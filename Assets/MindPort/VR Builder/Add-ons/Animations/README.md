# Animations for VR Builder

## Introduction
This add-on for VR Builder allows you to animate scene objects in your VR processes without any coding required.

You can use it to simulate movement of machinery like robots or carts, open doors, simulate objects transformations and much more.

Please check the manual in the `Documentation` folder for more information.

## Requirements
This module requires VR Builder version 0.5.0 or newer to be present in the same project in order to work.

## Quick Start
The easiest way to get started with this add-on is to check out the included demo scene.

If it is the first time you open the demo scene, you will have to do it through the menu: `Tools > VR Builder > Demo Scenes > Animations`. This is necessary as a script will copy the demo course in the StreamingAssets folder. After the first time, the demo scene can be opened normally.

Press Play to try out the behaviors included in this add-on. The demo scene includes a station for every behavior. You can teleport there and check out some practical uses of the included behaviors.

Don't forget to check out the course itself for examples on how to use those behaviors! You can open the Workflow Editor through `Tools > VR Builder > Open Workflow Editor`.
