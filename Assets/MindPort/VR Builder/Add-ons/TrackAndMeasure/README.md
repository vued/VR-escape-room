# Track-and-Measure-for-VR-Builder

## Introduction

This add-on for VR Builder focuses on tracking performance of the VR user, and provides tools like timers and point trackers. With it, it is easy to measure the time taken to perform tasks and to assign scores while providing feedback to the user.

## Requirements

This add-on requires VR Builder version 1.2.0 or later to work.

## Quick Start

You can check out the main features of this add-on in the provided demo scene. After importing the package in a properly set-up VR Builder project, you can access the demo scene from the menu `Tools > VR Builder > Demo Scenes > Track and Measure`. It is necessary to open the demo scene from the menu at least the first time, so a script will copy the required process file in the `StreamingAssets` folder.

The demo scene includes two stations, which highlight respectively point tracking and time tracking. Feel free to try those in VR. You can also open the Workflow Editor to see an example of how the provided conditions and behaviors can be used in a process.

You can find a comprehensive manual in the `Documentation` folder.
