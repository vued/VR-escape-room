# States-and-Data-for-VR-Builder

## Introduction

The States and Data add-on provides developers the tools to create processes more complex and customized than before.

Thanks to the support of variables in the VR Builder process, it is possible to store values to create triggers or track performance, and to create branching processes with a variety of outcomes.

The states feature allows VR Builder process to interact with objects in the scene by changing and reading states instead of handling all the object's logic. This allows the user to quickly write custom code and easily integrate it in the VR Builder process, opening the way to endless customization and better performance.

## Requirements

This add-on requires VR Builder version 1.3.0 or later to work.

## Quick Start

You can check out the main features of this add-on in the provided demo scene. After importing the package in a properly set-up VR Builder project, you can access the demo scene from the menu `Tools > VR Builder > Demo Scenes > States and Data`. It is necessary to open the demo scene from the menu at least the first time, so a script will copy the required process file in the `StreamingAssets` folder.

The demo scene consists of a color mixing machine. The user adds bottles of color in the machine to mix a new color, then can press the button to spawn a ball of the created color. It uses the data properties included in this add-on for storing and calculating the mixed color, while the machine is controlled by states.

You can press Play to try out the scene, or open the Workflow Editor to check out how the process is made.

Additionally, you can find a tutorial on how this demo scene was created on our [website](https://www.mindport.co/vr-builder-learning-path/how-to-create-a-color-mixing-machine-in-vr).

You can find a comprehensive manual in the `Documentation` folder.
