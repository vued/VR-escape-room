## Introduction

Welcome to VR Builder! This package will allow you to download and import the VR Builder package, and contains a demo scene highlighting the VR Builder core functionalities.

The scene consists in a simple process that can be used as an example on how to build courses with the editor, as well as a showcase of the building blocks available in the free core package.

You can find more comprehensive documentation in the `Documentation` folder.

## Requirements

### Unity Versions
VR Builder supports Unity 2019 and above.

### Deployment Platforms
We support all common tethered and all-in-one devices, such as the product palettes Oculus, Vive, WMR devices, Pico, etc.
Note that due to compatibility issues between Unity XRI and OpenVR, we only support HTC Vive and HTC Vive Pro on Unity 2019. We expect support for Unity 2020 and higher soon.

### Additional dependencies
The demo scene needs the VR Builder package to be present in the project in order to work. An automated check runs on compile and will prompt the user to download the package if necessary.

Alternatively, the package can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/MindPort-GmbH/VR-Builder-Core/releases).

## Opening the Demo Scene

Once the VR Builder package is installed, it will show the setup wizard. This will guide the user through the setup for the chosen platform, and offer the option to open the Demo Scene afterwards.

Alternatively, the Demo Scene can be opened from `Tools > VR Builder > Demo Scenes > Core`.

**Note:** If it's the first time opening the Demo Scene, the methods above will copy the demo training course file to the project's `StreamingAssets` folder. This is necessary for VR Builder to work correctly. 

## Exploring the Demo Scene

The Demo Scene contains a simple process. The user can choose to teleport to the left station, or to the right station.

Each station offers a task to complete in order to proceed, built with the available functionalities in VR Builder.

Once the user completes the task, they can move back and to the other station.
